###### Plain And Direct Language Additions for Java

## What is it?

PADLA is a collection of useful general-purpose utilities for Java aimed at fulfilling common needs.
It uses functional approach intensively and attempts to follow OOP-approach as right as possible.
In addition to common tools, it does also provide more specific ones aimed at maximal productivity.

## Dependencies

As its dependencies PADLA uses:
- Compiletime:
  - [Lombok](https://github.com/rzwitserloot/lombok) for generating boilerplate stuff
  - [Jetbrains Annotations](https://github.com/JetBrains/java-annotations) for documenting code logic
- Testing:
  - [Junit5](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/) with related sub-tools for testing
  - [Hamcrest](https://github.com/hamcrest/JavaHamcrest) for more creating more readable tests
  - [Mockito](https://github.com/mockito/mockito) for mocking in tests
- Additional (these are not inherited by default and are required only if using specific classes):
  - [ASM](https://gitlab.ow2.org/asm/asm) for runtime class generation (if using classes annotated with `@UsesBytecodeModification(CommonBytecodeLibrary.ASM)`)
  - [Javassist](https://github.com/jboss-javassist/javassist) for runtime class generation (if using classes annotated with `@UsesBytecodeModification(CommonBytecodeLibrary.JAVASSIST)`)
- Optional (these are not required at all but allow some extra integrations and optimizations):
  - [Caffeine](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine) for caching of internal components
